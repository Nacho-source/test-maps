# test-maps

This project has been created to set up a [library](https://github.com/Agontuk/react-native-geolocation-service) that must be used in a non-solid and already used [app](https://github.com/cloudx-labs/librologiaApp).

Here are a couple of steps that probably should be followed in order to get through some known issues:

1. Fix `pod install`: https://stackoverflow.com/a/69137723/18206477
2. Fix pod deps: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71104305/18206477
3. Fix `npm run ios`: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70942411/18206477
